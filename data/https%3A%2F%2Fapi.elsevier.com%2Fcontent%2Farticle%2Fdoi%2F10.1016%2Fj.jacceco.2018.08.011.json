This study examines an important source of uncertainty that likely cannot be influenced by most managers and investors: uncertainty about government economic policy. We find that this uncertainty is associated with increased bid-ask spreads and decreased stock price reactions to earnings surprises. Managers respond to this uncertainty by increasing their voluntary disclosures, but these disclosures only partly mitigate the bid-ask spread increase. We conclude that government economic policy uncertainty is an important component of firms\u2019 information environments and managers\u2019 voluntary disclosure decisions.\n               ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Corporate disclosure"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Economic policy uncertainty"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Information asymmetry"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165410118300958", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165410118300958", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85052733263", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85052733263", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85052733263", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20180821", "$": "2018-08-21"}}}}}
